                MacBook AND Watch, Gail has kept me at the cutting edge. Without overwhelming me with the details of how computers work, she provided simple instructions for setup and use. Then, with remarkable patience, she is there to answer my impatient questions”</p>

            <p>"I have worked with Gail for decades. Her superior technical skill with both Apple and PC devices is unparalleled. She is able to solve any issues I have ever had with my computer, ipad or phone. Just as impressive as Gail's mastery of machines is her excellent way with people. When teaching clients how to navigate their devices, Gail is non-judgemental, patient and kind. For clients who feel intimidated by new technology, Gail puts them at ease and even makes them eager to learn new skills. Whether you're a technical Luddite or a computer geek, Gail should be your first call for anything apple or PC."
