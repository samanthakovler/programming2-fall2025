        <h3>Meet Gail</h3>
        <p>
          I have been helping people with mac products for about 30 years….from computers, to networking,
          to iPads, to iPhones to the recent Apple Watches. I started out interested in learning about these devices.
          Then, because I am a problem solver by nature, when people asked me questions, I loved figuring out answers.
          I also found it interesting to find just the right way to help each person to learn how to do exactly what he
          or she wanted to do. So it’s a combination of technology and people and that excites me.

        <h3>How She Helps</h3>
        <p>
          All my work is for free! People come to me with questions like: why is my iphone doing this?
          How can I make my iPad do this? Why doesn’t it do what it’s supposed to do?
          I very often can help someone over the phone or on zoom but I also can come to someone's house
          if they are in the Chicago area for computer issues.
